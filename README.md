Tests you most on the ones you find hardest and adds new numbers if you're doing well.

To learn to convert between binary and decimal, navigate in terminal/command line to where you store this repo and run: python bibr.py rand

To learn to add binary numbers run: python add.py

For both of these you can add -u NAME to store your scores in a file called NAME.txt and to allow multiple users. This is optional
